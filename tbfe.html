        - It states that even flipping of a butterfly wings can cause Tsunami in the other side of the world. 
          Whatever we do in our life is not limited to us, it causes ripples. 
                        
        - In other words, a small action can led to a totally different event which you cannot even imagine, it 
          might cause. 
        
        - Just because a teacher was lazy to take a class -> i met someone -> which set a chain of multiple events 
          and here I am waking up at 5:00 a.m. everyday, the person who was sleeping till 10. 
          Does it make any sense? Not to you but for me. 
    
       
        - things happens, as they are meant to. we cannot change that. for our future self, our past is 
          pre-determined so is our future for now.
