    - It states that even flipping of a butterfly wings can cause Tsunami in the other side of the world. 
      Whatever we do in our life is not limited to us, it causes ripples. 
                    
    - In other words, a small action can led to a totally different event which you cannot even imagine, it 
      might cause. 
    
    - Just because a teacher was lazy to take a class 
      I saw a girl and here I am waking up at 5:00 a.m. everyday, the person who was sleeping till 10. 
      Does it make any sense? Not to you but for me. 

    - When I was in 12th standard, my class teacher made me sit with a guy, you know one of those guys i just 
      hate. extreme extrovert, do not study at all and always careless. Fast forward an year, and we became 
      best friends. both shared same philosophy to some extent, and much more thing. I didn't gave JEE becoz 
      no one did in my friend circle. So i decided to do BCA, at the very last moment, the only exam i gave 
      was that BS. Cleared it, didnt even studied. Made OP friends here, saw a halie's comet ( if you know 
      what it means you are my true friend) though it's true you can't catch a comet... just wonder at her 
      beauty and wonder what if...?

    - totally unrelated, but that Comet emoji looks like cumshot lol

    - also things happens, as they are meant to. we cannot change that. for our future self, our past is 
      pre-determined so is our future for now.
