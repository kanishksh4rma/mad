Working type	Data stored in RAM can be retrieved and altered.	Data stored in ROM can only be read.
Use	Used to store the data that has to be currently processed by CPU temporarily.	It stores the instructions required during bootstrap of the computer.
Speed	It is a high-speed memory.	It is much slower than the RAM.
CPU Interaction	The CPU can access the data stored on it.	The CPU can not access the data stored on it unless the data is stored in RAM.
Size and Capacity	Large size with higher capacity.	Small size with less capacity.
Used as/in	CPU Cache, Primary memory.	Firmware, Micro-controllers
Accessibility	The data stored is easily accessible	The data stored is not as easily accessible as in RAM
Cost	Costlier	cheaper than RAM.
