    <title>Motherfucking Website</title>

        <h1>This is a aesthetic website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's fucking perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. 
You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you 
some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site.
 You think your 69 API calls and 1000 lines of JS will give a boner.
 Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe 
your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens (mostly)</li>
            <li>Shows random grudge pics at the top</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
            <li>Made on linux (i use arch btw)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a 
motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking 
trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You
 spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some
 motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will 
never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that 
shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h3>It's fucking lightweight!</h3>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed 
facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 
100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background 
color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so 
you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You 
piece of shit.</p>
        
<p>Also, it has a dark-tone & the gifs are <span style="font-weight:600;" >kawaiiiiiiii!</span></p>
